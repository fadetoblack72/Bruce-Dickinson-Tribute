    <p><em>Here, a relatively recent live performance by heavy metal band Iron Maiden, featuring Bruce Dickinson on vocals.</em></p> 
    <p>Paul Bruce Dickinson, better known simply as Bruce Dickinson, or affectionately "The Air Raid Siren" by fans, is most famous for being the lead singer of Iron Maiden. Lesser known, yet still impressive, is his wide variety of other talents and pursuits both within and without the music world. Bruce Dickinson is a man worthy of admiration, both for his powerful voice as well as his ingenuity and determination for mastering each of his myriad passions. With a prolific solo musical career, published writing, and a tremendous variety of aviation-related work, Dickinson has been a man who has rarely taken a break from accomplishment throughout his life.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">"I think the best way to find out about something is to try to do it to the max. A lot of people take up a hobby or sport and then find an excuse not to carry on with it. Once I start something, I won't stop until I'm as good at it as I'll ever be."
